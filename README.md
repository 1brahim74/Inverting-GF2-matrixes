Please note that the code in this repository is provided as a proof-of-concept and a practical demonstration of the described algorithms. The primary goal is to serve as a clear, functional reference for these advanced matrix operations over GF(2). The focus has been on algorithmic correctness and clarity rather than creating a production-ready, high-performance library.

While the tools are robust for their intended purpose, there are clear improvements in technical and algorithmic side.

The pivoted matrix inversion is a significant improvement over naive block inversion but does not cover all edge cases that a full LUP decomposition would. It may still fail on certain invertible matrices where both diagonal blocks (A11 and A22) are singular.

The matrix repair tool uses a simple, effective heuristic. It is not guaranteed to find a solution or the theoretically optimal bit-flip in all possible cases.

Potential Technical Enhancements
The code is intentionally structured as simple, self-contained programs for ease of compilation and understanding. A production-grade implementation would involve:

A more modular, library-based architecture (.h and .cpp files).

More robust and structured error handling (e.g., custom exceptions).

The use of build systems like CMake for cross-platform compatibility.

Potential for parallelization (e.g., using OpenMP or C++ threads) for enhanced performance on very large matrices.

In summary, this repository successfully demonstrates the functionality and correctness of the core ideas. It is an excellent starting point for academic exploration, testing, and further development into a more generalized library. Feel free to contact if you have ideas that may improve the codes.
